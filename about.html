                If one were asked to describe my personality they would probably describe me as a friendly person who definitely has a sense of humor. 
                I adore Macdonalds food, especially their coffee, and I hate myself for such admiration. I have a dream from the childhood - to get a dog and 
                I hope one day my appartments will allow me to make this dream come true.

                I love summer and late May. Nothing can be better than lazy sunny days near the sea. The only one thing I really like in winter is ice-skating. I skate because it is my passion.
                It challenges me both mentally and physically and allows me to express myself in many ways. I like the wind in my face and swoosh sound of my skates. I feel free on the ice and it is fun to learn something new. I skate simply because I love it!  In my free time I do a lot of activities. Some of them are sports. For example, I like cycling around the neighbourhood, playing badminton with my friends and jogging round the park.
